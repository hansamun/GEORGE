            Georgie Boy the monkey, who originally joined his family as an emotional support animal, quickly became
            beloved by millions of followers thanks to cheeky photos of him and his adorable demeanor, which his family
            often showed off on TikTok. He regularly received gifts from around the world, including everything from fan
            art and snacks to toys and stickers. He even opened his own fan mail on video, delighting viewers with his
            exuberant attitude and "monkey selfies."

          <p className="font-medium text-blue-100 fade-in-up stagger-2">
            Sadly, on June 7th at 4PM, George passed away. "We have devastating news," the family wrote, "George went to
            the vet for a regular check up on his teeth. During, there were complications with the anaesthesia, starting
            a long fight for his life. Through the fight, George was sent thousands of thoughts and prayers with the
            hope that he would make it."
          </p>

          <p className="font-medium text-blue-100 fade-in-up stagger-3">
            The family continued, "On June 7th at 4pm Central Georgie Boy passed away. George was a light when things
            seemed dark. And he was a reminder of the love that exists in all of us. Though the fun-loving life of
            George has left, his spirit of hope and love lives on. We love you, George."
          </p>

          <p className="font-medium text-blue-100 fade-in-up stagger-4">
            Now, for the anniversary of George's passing, the family are planning a commemorative 'Based George's' token
            which will be coming to the Solana blockchain to raise awareness, and raise money for charity. The family
            also are in the process of relaunching their 17 million follower TikTok account with brand new content of
            George's family. So together, we can keep George's memory alive forever.
